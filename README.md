## About
deck.gl is a open source, webGL-powered visualization framework for large-scale datasets. This repo is a sample taken from the a google.dev codelab.

## Getting Started
You *must* enable the Maps JavaScript API in Google Cloud Platform. In `app.js` replace `API_KEY` with your actual API key.

Run the following in the `map` directory:

1. `npm i`
2. `npm start`

This will install the needed dependencies and run the app locally in your browser.
